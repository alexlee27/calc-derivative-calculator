# A Calculus Differentiation Calculator ... from Scratch!
A calculus differentiation calculator from scratch using [binary expression trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_expression_tree) and a lot of recursion.

## How it works
### Input
- Using the [Shunting yard algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunting_yard_algorithm), the program converts a "normal" (also known as "infix notation"; e.g. $(2 + 3) \times 5 - 1$) mathematical expression to a [binary expression tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_expression_tree) object.
### Differentiation

## Credits
- [This Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_expression_tree) and [this GeeksForGeeks article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/program-to-convert-infix-notation-to-expression-tree/) which helped me with understanding and implementing the Shunting yard algorithm.
- [Prof Liu and Prof Badr's U of T CSC110/111 notes](https://www.teach.cs.toronto.edu/~csc110y/fall/notes/) which helped me with understanding abstract syntax trees.
