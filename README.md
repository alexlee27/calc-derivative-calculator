# Calculus Derivative Calculator
This is a **calculus [derivative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative) (differentiation) calculator** built with Python from *scratch* (without any math-related libraries like SymPy!) using [binary expression trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_expression_tree) and a lot of [recursion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion_(computer_science)).

## :bulb: Motivation
After completing my first year of studying computer science at university, I wanted to use what I've learned to build a fun side project. Some of the main topics that my courses covered include [recursion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion_(computer_science)) and [trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(data_structure)). I thought these two tools would come in handy for building something like a derivative calculator: the way recursion works reminded me of the [chain rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_rule) in calculus a lot, and trees are often used for representing expressions (such as [abstract syntax trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree) often used by compilers).

## âš™ How it works
### Input
- Using the [Shunting yard algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunting_yard_algorithm), the program converts a "normal" (also known as "infix notation"; e.g. $(2 + 3) \times 5 - 1$) mathematical expression to a [binary expression tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_expression_tree) object.

## ðŸ“š Credits
- [This Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_expression_tree) and [this GeeksForGeeks article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/program-to-convert-infix-notation-to-expression-tree/) which helped me with understanding and implementing the Shunting yard algorithm.
- [Prof Liu and Prof Badr's U of T CSC110/111 notes](https://www.teach.cs.toronto.edu/~csc110y/fall/notes/) which helped me with understanding abstract syntax trees.
