# Calculus Derivative Calculator (Beta)
This is a **calculus [derivative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative) (differentiation) calculator** built with Python from *scratch* (without any math-related libraries like SymPy!) using [binary expression trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_expression_tree) and a lot of recursion.

## âš™ How it works
### Input
- Using the [Shunting yard algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunting_yard_algorithm), the program converts a "normal" (also known as "infix notation"; e.g. $(2 + 3) \times 5 - 1$) mathematical expression to a [binary expression tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_expression_tree) object.
